# Music Listening Time Analysis: Before and After Reduction Decision

## Project Overview

  This project examines my music listening habits before and after I decided to cut down the time spent on listening to music. Using my YouTube Music data over a period of four months (September to December 2024), I aim to explore trends and quantify the impact of my decision.

## Dataset
  
  <ins>Source:</ins> YouTube Music listening history.
  
  <ins>Time Period:</ins> October 2024 to December 2024.
  
  <ins>Data Description: Includes information on:</ins>
  
  Date and time of listening sessions.
  
  Duration of each session.
  
  Type of music (e.g., genre, mood, etc.).
  
  Frequency of sessions per day.
  
    
### Note: The raw dataset will not be shared for privacy reasons, but all analysis scripts and derived data summaries will be provided.

## Project Objectives
<ins>Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover:</ins>

  Listening patterns over time.
  Peak listening hours.
  Genre preferences and trends.
  
<ins>Create data visualizations to represent:</ins>

  Total listening time per week/month.
  Changes in listening habits pre- and post-decision.
  
<ins>Share findings through:</ins>

  A detailed report/website (not sure yet).
  A project page hosted on GitHub.

    
## Project Plan
  <ins>Data Preparation:</ins>
  
  Import YouTube Music history into a usable format (e.g., CSV, JSON).
  
  Clean and preprocess data for analysis.
  
<ins>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</ins>
  
  Analyze total and average listening time.
  
  Identify trends and anomalies.
  
<ins>Visualization:</ins>
  
  Use Python libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn) to create insightful charts.

<ins>Report & Presentation:</ins>
  
  Summarize and display findings in a report or using a website.
  
<ins>GitHub Repository:</ins>
  
  Upload analysis scripts and visualizations.
  
  Ensure a clear file structure and .gitignore to exclude raw data.
  
<ins>Peer Evaluation:</ins>
  
  Engage with classmatesâ€™ projects and provide constructive feedback.

  
## Tools & Techniques
  <ins>Programming Languages:</ins> Python
  
  <ins>Libraries:</ins> Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
  
  <ins>Version Control:</ins> Git and GitHub
  
  <ins>Visualization Tools:</ins> Python plotting libraries, possibly Tableau for advanced visualizations.
  
## Expected Outcomes
  Clear insights into the change in my listening habits.
  
  A user-friendly GitHub repository showcasing the analysis.
