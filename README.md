Music Listening Time Analysis: Before and After Reduction Decision

Project Overview
  This project examines my music listening habits before and after I decided to cut down the time spent on listening to music. Using my YouTube Music data over a period of two months (October to December 2024), I aim to explore trends and quantify the impact of my decision.

Dataset
  Source: YouTube Music listening history.
  Time Period: October 2024 to December 2024.
  Data Description: Includes information on:
    Date and time of listening sessions.
    Duration of each session.
    Type of music (e.g., genre, mood, etc.).
    Frequency of sessions per day.
    
Note: The raw dataset will not be shared for privacy reasons, but all analysis scripts and derived data summaries will be provided.

Project Objectives
  Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover:

  Listening patterns over time.
    Peak listening hours.
    Genre preferences and trends.
    
  Create data visualizations to represent:
    Total listening time per week/month.
    Changes in listening habits pre- and post-decision.
    
  Share findings through:
    A detailed report/website (not sure yet).
    A project page hosted on GitHub.

    
Project Plan
  Data Preparation:
  Import YouTube Music history into a usable format (e.g., CSV, JSON).
  Clean and preprocess data for analysis.
  
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
  Analyze total and average listening time.
  Identify trends and anomalies.
  
Visualization:
  Use Python libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn) to create insightful charts.

Report & Presentation:
  Summarize and display findings in a report or using a website.
  
GitHub Repository:
  Upload analysis scripts and visualizations.
  Ensure a clear file structure and .gitignore to exclude raw data.
  
Peer Evaluation:
  Engage with classmatesâ€™ projects and provide constructive feedback.

  
Tools & Techniques
  Programming Languages: Python
  Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
  Version Control: Git and GitHub
  Visualization Tools: Python plotting libraries, possibly Tableau for advanced visualizations.
  
Expected Outcomes
  Clear insights into the change in my listening habits.
  A user-friendly GitHub repository showcasing the analysis.
