REACT_APP_PURPOSE_TEXT = "The purpose of my project is to explore the impact of reducing my music listening time on both my daily habits and emotional well-being. On November 12th, I made a deliberate decision to cut back on the time I spent listening to music, as it had become a dominant part of my day. To assess the effects of this change, I analyzed my YouTube Music history from September to December, comparing my listening patterns before and after the decision. Recognizing the positive influence music often has on my mood, I also began tracking my mood daily from November 12th onwards to investigate how changes in my listening habits affected my emotional state. This analysis aims to provide insights into the relationship between music consumption and mood, helping me understand the broader implications of this lifestyle adjustment."
REACT_APP_DATA_COLLECTION_TEXT1 = "To collect the data for my analysis, I began by exporting my YouTube history using Google Takeout. This provided me with a file named watch-history.html, which contained my entire YouTube and YouTube Music history. After examining the structure and format of the file, I identified sections specific to YouTube Music by checking if the title of a section was labeled as "YouTube Music." These sections contained details about the songs I had listened to. I extracted the song details and exported them into a CSV file with columns for Song Title, URL, Artist, Date, and Time. I then sorted the songs chronologically, from oldest to newest, and filtered the data to include only the period from September 1, 2024, to December 31, 2024."
REACT_APP_DATA_COLLECTION_TEXT2 = "One challenge I faced was that the song details did not include the duration of each song. To address this, I calculated the duration by taking the time difference between a song and the subsequent song in the history. However, I needed to handle cases where there was a significant gap between two songs, such as when I paused listening for a while or resumed the next day. To account for this, I set a maximum duration limit of 7 minutes. If the calculated duration exceeded this limit, I marked it as "unknown." To handle the unknown durations, I calculated the average duration of all songs with valid durations and replaced the missing durations with this average. This ensured that the data remained consistent and usable for analysis."
REACT_APP_DATA_COLLECTION_TEXT3 = "For mood data, I collected it manually by recording my mood at the end of each day starting from November 12, 2024, the day I decided to reduce my music listening time. I rated my mood on a scale from 0 to 5, with 0 being the worst mood and 5 being the best. These mood entries were compiled into a CSV file for use in my analysis."
REACT_APP_DATA_COLLECTION_TEXT4 = "With my YouTube Music history and mood data prepared, I proceeded to analyze the data to explore the effects of reducing my music listening time on both my listening habits and emotional well-being. This comprehensive approach allowed me to draw meaningful insights into the relationship between music consumption and mood."

REACT_APP_ALL_GRAPH = "The graph illustrates the average listening time per month from September to December 2024, highlighting a significant decline in listening time after November 12, when I decided to reduce my music consumption. In September and October, the average listening times were relatively high, with October showing the highest average of approximately 100 minutes per day. This suggests consistent and prolonged music listening during those months. In November, there is a noticeable decrease in average listening time, reflecting the impact of my decision midway through the month. By December, the average listening time dropped substantially, reaching its lowest level, indicating that I successfully adhered to my commitment to reduce music listening. This trend demonstrates the effectiveness of my decision in restraining listening time over the analyzed period."
