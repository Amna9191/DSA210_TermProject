REACT_APP_PURPOSE_TEXT = "The purpose of my project is to explore the impact of reducing my music listening time on both my daily habits and emotional well-being. On November 12th, I made a deliberate decision to cut back on the time I spent listening to music, as it had become a dominant part of my day. To assess the effects of this change, I analyzed my YouTube Music history from September to December, comparing my listening patterns before and after the decision. Recognizing the positive influence music often has on my mood, I also began tracking my mood daily from November 12th onwards to investigate how changes in my listening habits affected my emotional state. This analysis aims to provide insights into the relationship between music consumption and mood, helping me understand the broader implications of this lifestyle adjustment."

REACT_APP_DATA_COLLECTION_TEXT1 = "To collect the data for my analysis, I began by exporting my YouTube history using Google Takeout. This provided me with a file named watch-history.html, which contained my entire YouTube and YouTube Music history. After examining the structure and format of the file, I identified sections specific to YouTube Music by checking if the title of a section was labeled as YouTube Music. These sections contained details about the songs I had listened to. I extracted the song details and exported them into a CSV file with columns for Song Title, URL, Artist, Date, and Time. I then sorted the songs chronologically, from oldest to newest, and filtered the data to include only the period from September 1, 2024, to December 31, 2024."
REACT_APP_DATA_COLLECTION_TEXT2 = "One challenge I faced was that the song details did not include the duration of each song. To address this, I calculated the duration by taking the time difference between a song and the subsequent song in the history. However, I needed to handle cases where there was a significant gap between two songs, such as when I paused listening for a while or resumed the next day. To account for this, I set a maximum duration limit of 7 minutes. If the calculated duration exceeded this limit, I marked it as unknown. To handle the unknown durations, I calculated the average duration of all songs with valid durations and replaced the missing durations with this average. This ensured that the data remained consistent and usable for analysis."
REACT_APP_DATA_COLLECTION_TEXT3 = "For mood data, I collected it manually by recording my mood at the end of each day starting from November 12, 2024, the day I decided to reduce my music listening time. I rated my mood on a scale from 0 to 5, with 0 being the worst mood and 5 being the best. These mood entries were compiled into a CSV file for use in my analysis."
REACT_APP_DATA_COLLECTION_TEXT4 = "With my YouTube Music history and mood data prepared, I proceeded to analyze the data to explore the effects of reducing my music listening time on both my listening habits and emotional well-being. This comprehensive approach allowed me to draw meaningful insights into the relationship between music consumption and mood."

REACT_APP_ALL_GRAPH  = "The graph illustrates the average listening time per month from September to December 2024, highlighting a significant decline in listening time after November 12, when I decided to reduce my music consumption. In September and October, the average listening times were relatively high, with October showing the highest average of approximately 100 minutes per day. This suggests consistent and prolonged music listening during those months. In November, there is a noticeable decrease in average listening time, reflecting the impact of my decision midway through the month. By December, the average listening time dropped substantially, reaching its lowest level, indicating that I successfully adhered to my commitment to reduce music listening. This trend demonstrates the effectiveness of my decision in restraining listening time over the analyzed period."

REACT_APP_SEPT_GRAPH = "The graph illustrates the daily listening time for September 2024, showcasing significant fluctuations in music consumption throughout the month. The listening time reached peaks of over 175 minutes on several days, such as the 6th and 20th, indicating periods of extended music consumption. However, there are also notable dips, with listening times dropping below 50 minutes on multiple occasions, such as the 9th and 15th. These variations suggest that music consumption during September was inconsistent, potentially influenced by daily routines or external factors. The data highlights a pattern of sporadic listening habits, with some days showing intense engagement with music while others reflect minimal or no listening activity. Overall, September exhibited a relatively high average listening time, setting the stage for comparison with later months when a conscious effort was made to reduce listening."

REACT_APP_OCT_GRAPH1 = "The graph for October 2024 shows a wide variation in daily listening times, similar to September but with some distinct patterns. Early in the month, listening time peaked sharply, exceeding 200 minutes on October 2, followed by a gradual decline. Mid-month, listening times appear more consistent, hovering around 100 minutes, before dropping significantly around October 21 and 22. Toward the end of the month, listening time increased again, with notable peaks on October 24 and October 31."
REACT_APP_OCT_GRAPH2 = "This data indicates sporadic listening habits, with high engagement at specific intervals and significant dips in between. The high average listening time for October, as shown in earlier summaries, is likely driven by the substantial peaks early and late in the month. These fluctuations suggest October was a month of varied routines, with some days of intense music listening and others with minimal or no activity. This pattern contrasts sharply with the more deliberate effort to reduce listening time starting in mid-November."

REACT_APP_NOV_GRAPH1 = "The graph for November 2024 shows a clear shift in listening behavior as the month progresses. Early November is marked by high levels of music consumption, peaking at over 350 minutes on November 2. However, after the decision to reduce listening time on November 12, a significant downward trend becomes apparent."
REACT_APP_NOV_GRAPH2 = "Before November 12, the listening time is highly variable, with multiple days exceeding 150 minutes. In contrast, after November 12, listening time drops noticeably, stabilizing at lower levels, with most days falling below 50 minutes. By the end of the month, listening time is almost negligible, indicating a strong adherence to the decision to cut back."
REACT_APP_NOV_GRAPH3 = "This pattern demonstrates the immediate and sustained impact of the decision, reflecting a deliberate effort to minimize music consumption and focus on other priorities. The data highlights a stark difference in habits before and after the decision, making November a pivotal month in the analysis."

REACT_APP_DEC_GRAPH1 = "The graph for December 2024 reflects a continued effort to maintain reduced listening time, consistent with the decision made in mid-November. Most days in December show listening times below 50 minutes, with a few exceptions. The most notable peak occurs on December 13, where listening time exceeded 140 minutes, representing a significant deviation from the otherwise low listening pattern."
REACT_APP_DEC_GRAPH2 = "For the remainder of the month, listening time remains relatively minimal, with brief spikes such as on December 23 and December 28. These peaks could indicate specific events or moments when music was more heavily consumed. Overall, December demonstrates a successful adherence to the goal of reducing listening time, with the single large spike standing out as an exception rather than a recurring trend. This sustained low listening pattern further highlights the long-term impact of the decision to reduce music consumption."

REACT_APP_DECISION1_1 = "The graph provides a clear visual comparison of listening time before and after November 12, the date when the decision to reduce music listening time was made. Before November 12, represented by the blue line, listening patterns were highly variable, with frequent spikes exceeding 150 minutes and even surpassing 300 minutes on some days. This indicates a period of significant and often prolonged music consumption. The high variability suggests an irregular pattern of music listening, with days of intense engagement followed by brief declines."
REACT_APP_DECISION1_2 = "In contrast, the orange line, representing listening time after November 12, shows a dramatic and consistent reduction. While there are occasional small spikes, the majority of listening times remain below 50 minutes, and many days show minimal or no music listening. This stark difference highlights the immediate and sustained impact of the decision to reduce music consumption."
REACT_APP_DECISION1_3 = "The red vertical line marking November 12 emphasizes the turning point in listening habits. The post-decision data reflects a deliberate effort to maintain reduced listening time, demonstrating the effectiveness of the commitment. This graph underscores the success of the decision and provides a clear visual of how music listening patterns shifted significantly as a result."

REACT_APP_DECISION2_1 = "The graph provides a comprehensive view of listening time before and after November 12, 2024, with trend lines offering additional insights into the changes over time. The blue dots represent the listening time before November 12, while the orange dots represent the time after the decision to reduce music listening. The red dashed line marks the decision date."
REACT_APP_DECISION2_2 = "The trend line before November 12 (blue dashed line) shows a slight upward trajectory, indicating that listening time was gradually increasing in the months leading up to the decision. This reflects inconsistent habits, with many days showing prolonged listening sessions. In contrast, the trend line after November 12 (orange dashed line) displays a clear downward slope, highlighting a steady and significant reduction in listening time over the following weeks."
REACT_APP_DECISION2_3 = "Initially, the data suggests that reducing listening time was challenging, as evidenced by some days shortly after November 12 where listening time was still relatively high. However, as time progressed, the habit of listening less became more consistent, with most days showing minimal or no music consumption by December. This demonstrates the substantial impact of the decision on my behavior, as the trend indicates successful adaptation to reduced music consumption."
REACT_APP_DECISION2_4 = "Overall, the graph shows a stark contrast in listening habits before and after the decision, with the trend lines emphasizing the effectiveness of the change in building a sustainable new habit."

REACT_APP_DECISION3_1 = "The histogram compares the distribution of listening times before and after November 12, 2024, providing a clear picture of the frequency of listening durations in both periods. The blue bars represent listening times before November 12, while the orange bars represent listening times after November 12."
REACT_APP_DECISION3_2 = "Before the decision date, the data shows a wide spread of listening times, with a significant number of days falling between 100 and 250 minutes, and some days even exceeding 300 minutes. This indicates a pattern of prolonged music listening during this period, with more variability in listening durations."
REACT_APP_DECISION3_3 = "In contrast, after November 12, there is a dramatic shift in the distribution. Most listening times are concentrated below 50 minutes, with very few days exceeding this threshold. The sharp reduction in the range and frequency of higher listening times reflects the success of the decision to reduce music consumption. The absence of listening times above 100 minutes after November 12 further highlights the significant behavioral change."
REACT_APP_DECISION3_4 = "Overall, the histogram illustrates the effectiveness of the decision in reducing not only the average listening time but also the frequency of longer listening sessions. It visually emphasizes the strong adherence to the goal of minimizing music listening in the post-decision period."

REACT_APP_MOOD1_1 = "The graph illustrates the relationship between listening time and mood after the decision to reduce music consumption, with mood rated on a scale from 0 (worst) to 5 (best). The scatter plot reveals some intriguing patterns."
REACT_APP_MOOD1_2 = "Initially, my mood appeared to be influenced by listening time. On days with higher listening times, such as November 14 and December 13, my mood was better, with values close to 4 or 5. This suggests that music played a significant role in improving my emotional state during the early stages after the decision."
REACT_APP_MOOD1_3 = "However, as time progressed, the relationship between listening time and mood weakened. There are several instances where my mood remained relatively high (around 3–5) even on days with minimal or no listening time, such as in late November and throughout December. This shift suggests that I gradually adapted to the reduced listening time, and my mood became less dependent on music as a source of emotional regulation."
REACT_APP_MOOD1_4 = "Overall, the graph highlights an important transition. While music initially had a noticeable impact on my mood, I was able to maintain a positive emotional state over time even with significantly reduced music consumption. This demonstrates the success of my decision not only in reducing listening time but also in achieving emotional stability without relying heavily on music."

REACT_APP_MOOD2_1 = "The box plot visualizes the relationship between listening time and mood, showcasing the distribution of listening times for different mood levels (0 to 5). It provides insights into how listening time varies with mood and highlights key trends."
REACT_APP_MOOD2_2 = "For mood levels of 0 and 1, the listening time remains consistently low, with minimal variation and no outliers. This suggests that during days of poor mood, listening to music was either minimal or non-existent. As mood improves to levels 2 and 3, the listening time slightly increases, with a broader range of values, indicating that music consumption may start to play a role in improving mood on these days."
REACT_APP_MOOD2_3 = "The most notable trend is observed for mood levels 4 and 5. For a mood level of 5 (best mood), the distribution of listening times becomes significantly wider, with a median that is much higher compared to other mood levels and some values exceeding 120 minutes. This indicates that on days with the best mood, there is a strong association with longer listening times, suggesting that music may contribute to an elevated emotional state or be a result of such a state."
REACT_APP_MOOD2_4 = "Overall, the box plot shows that while listening time has a stronger association with higher mood levels, particularly 4 and 5, the relationship diminishes for lower mood levels, where listening time remains consistently low. This highlights the nuanced relationship between music consumption and mood, suggesting that music might serve as both a contributor to and a reflection of positive emotional states."
